# Kilimo-Bora
## Project Overview
**Kilimo Bora** is a web-based application designed to help Kenyan farmers share and access sustainable farming tips. Hunger remains a significant challenge in Kenya, with malnutrition and hunger-related deaths affecting many, especially in some regions. To address this, the platform promotes best farming practices that ensure high yields by leveraging farmers' firsthand experiences. By providing a space for farmers to exchange proven strategies, Kilimo Bora aims to empower the agricultural community and enhance food security.
